  <h2 id="noh2">How to become Dangerous and become the master of yourself?</h2>

   Most of us desperately want to become dangerous.

Not violent—capable. Controlled. Disciplined. Someone who can act when it matters.

Yet almost everyone fails for the same two reasons: discipline and motivation.<br><br>

I grew up loving the Rocky series. Like many people, I was inspired by the music, the speeches, the dramatic comeback arcs. But my opinion changed after reading a short, fun blog post about how movies like Rocky may have actually damaged our understanding of discipline

They taught us to worship motivation instead of systems.

The first question people ask when you talk about becoming dangerous is:
“Why would anyone hate me if I improve myself?”

The answer is simple.

Think about animals and lions.

Lions aren’t hated because they’re evil.
They’re hated because they’re powerful.

That’s the idea I explored in my very first blog post.

<p class="para">
  You can be dangerous without being evil. Being dangerous in your field—whatever that field is—depends on a few key factors:
  <strong style="color: green;">mental strength, discipline, and stable motivation.</strong>

  Mental strength has many layers. At the most basic level, it means learning how to absorb people’s comments about you:
  “Bro, are you joking?”
  “A CS graduate working in IT support? What a joke.”<br><br>

  In my opinion, starting from the basics is one of the most important steps toward becoming truly dangerous.
  For example, I would rather work as a Help Desk Analyst than rush into becoming a Pentester immediately after graduation.

  You might ask, “So are you saying that working directly in cybersecurity after graduation is a bad idea?”
  My answer is simple: choose what works best for you. But in my philosophy, starting from the basics is what creates true mastery.<br><br>

  Jumping straight into advanced fields (such as AI or cybersecurity in my area) can work.
  But for me, it means missing a lot of the real action: the foundations that actually make you dangerous.
  The problem is that basics are invisible.
  There is no applause for learning how systems fail, how users break things, or how boring problems repeat themselves.
  That is why most people avoid this phase—they want recognition before competence.<br><br>

  But this invisible work is where dangerous people are formed.
  When you spend time in the fundamentals, you see patterns others miss.
  You stop panicking when things go wrong, because you’ve already seen worse.

  Society praises speed, titles, and shortcuts.
  It rarely praises patience.
  Yet patience is what allows discipline to compound quietly over time.<br><br>

  This is also why becoming dangerous makes people uncomfortable.
  You don’t argue much.
  You don’t explain yourself.
  You don’t rush.
  Your confidence doesn’t come from motivation or hype—it comes from preparation.

  Lions don’t announce themselves before they hunt.
  They don’t seek approval from the herd.
  They move when it is time—and until then, they wait.

  Becoming dangerous is a long, lonely process.
  Most people will misunderstand it.
  Some will mock it.
  A few will resent it.

  But in the end, when pressure arrives and reality demands competence,
  dangerous people are the ones still standing.

 Another form of mental strength is resisting the urge to constantly prove that you know everything. Many people lie on their CV or LinkedIn just to look like the “ideal” candidate. But instead of talking trash, start doing real work.

Take me as an example: this blog is my first real project. I started building it when I decided to come back clean.<br><br> I couldn’t feel proud of my previous projects because almost 85% of them were AI-generated.

Face yourself and start acting like a real coder. Start by writing your own blog even if you don’t think you’re into web development. You might discover your passion while building it.

Don’t have motivation? Just start acting. Motivation will come when you see your blog come alive.

This article explains motivation extremely well — <a href="https://jamesclear.com/motivation" target="_blank">Read Here</a>.

<p class="para"> Motivation is unreliable. It comes and goes, depending on mood, energy, and external validation. Discipline is different. Discipline is showing up even when you don’t feel like it.

Stable motivation is not about feeling inspired every day. It’s about creating systems that force you to move forward—even on bad days. When I stopped waiting for motivation and started acting instead, everything changed.<br><br>

I didn’t start this blog because I felt confident or inspired. I started it because I chose discipline over comfort. At first, it felt slow and pointless. But as the blog grew, motivation followed naturally. Progress creates motivation—not the other way around.

If you want stable motivation, stop chasing excitement. Pick something small, commit to it, and work on it consistently. A blog is a perfect example: it’s simple, personal, and forces you to think, write, and build.

Discipline turns effort into identity. Do the work long enough, and you won’t need motivation anymore you’ll just be someone who shows up.</p>

  Mental strength isn’t about pretending to know more than you do or building a fake image online. It’s about honesty, discipline, and the courage to start from where you actually are. In a world where it’s easy to generate projects, posts, and even personalities with AI, real growth comes from doing the work yourself.<br><br>

You don’t need perfect motivation, a perfect plan, or approval from others. You need consistency. Start small. Build something real. Make mistakes. Learn in public. Whether it’s a blog, a side project, or a simple tool, what matters is that it’s yours.

Discipline will carry you when motivation disappears. Action will create confidence. And over time, showing up every day will shape your identity more than any title on a CV ever could.

Stop waiting. Start acting. The rest will follow.
